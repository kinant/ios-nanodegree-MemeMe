# Noted Issues:
- If Software Keyboard is not toggled before running the App, it will cause a bug were the entire view slides up. This bug will not occur if keyboard toggles on first use or if testing on a device. Have not figured out how to fix this issue. Disabling "Connect Hardware Keyboard" allows the keyboard to show up without this bug.
